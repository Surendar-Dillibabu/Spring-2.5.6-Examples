   <!-- 
     In this beans if you see we only have the setter/getters methods not any constructors. constructors are not needed since we are injecting the dependency through setters/getters.
     But departmentBean we are allowing the spring to inject through auto wire by name.
     
     Now spring will check if any bean has been declared with as per the name provided in the EmployeeBean.
     Then it will inject it.
     
     Auto wire byName uses setDepartmentBean method. Here if you want to check whether it's happening based on the name then you can change the 
     setDepartmentBean method name or below departmentBean id as different to check it
